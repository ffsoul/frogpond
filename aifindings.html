          Since AI image generation's uprising, I have always had a close eye on its development, whether I wanted to or not. Discussions over the ethics of training AI without the artists' consent happened frequently among my acquaintances on Twitter, and while I understood what was happening to an extent, I was relatively lax about having my work trained upon. I treated the action as a, "Yeah, that was bound to happen", and I didn't want to bother trying to fight the inevitable. 
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          ... On the other hand, I was absolutely tired of hearing how AI could replace my entire career in design. The endless drivel by AI enthusiasts showing off their work as if it could even compare to human made work drove me up the wall. It does spark a small worry though. What if AI was able to get to a working state? How accurate is it now and how accurate will it be in another year? Another month? These thoughts dug at my mind as I moved into starting this project. 
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          We started with using Teachable Machine to get us
          acclimated with machine learning models and artificial intelligence. My
          immediate thought was to try and create an "artificial version of
          myself." Something about making flawed versions of me felt very
          appealing, so as a simple starter project I decided to create a
          <a
            href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/koTjf4sjb/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            FUNNY or UNFUNNY image classifier </a
          >. By feeding the AI a small dataset of what I found humorous, I got
          the AI to "assume" (more on this later) what I thought of other
          images.
        </div>
        <img class="banner" src="assets/images/aiFindings/abbyCat.jpg" />
        <div class="paragraph">
          Unsurprisingly, the AI was inaccurate(because I find this image
          extremely funny). Because of all the :naruhodo: images in the dataset
          (see
          <a href="visinquiries.html">The Grand Naruhodo Count</a>), the model
          was heavily biased towards finding black and white images FUNNY. In
          comparison, there were many pictures of people in the UNFUNNY
          category, which led more realistic photos to be sorted together.

        <div class="paragraph">
          Over the course of the project introduction, we would continue to read
          into and experiment more with AI. An in-class demo to create a snake
          game with image recognition controls revealed to me how AI was fast to
          train with relatively good results, but would still have glaring
          flaws.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          I knew much of the information from the lectures already through
          exposure from social media, but they reinforced the negative aspects
          of AI and model training, such as the intensive emissions and
          disrespect of privacy and image rights. What was new to me though was
          the negative impact across the entire chain, leading back to the
          labeling of images.

          In addition, there were projects like Triple Chaser which were
          legitimate positive uses of AI, compared to many of the intrusive and
          abusive AI projects currently in circulation.

            The next few days of class would be spent discussing different
            topics around AI, analyzing AI anatomy, and questioning if certain
            designs should be using AI. All in all, I continued to develop my
            existing negative opinion of AI, capitalizing off other’s work in
            the dataset gathering, labeling, and generation processes. While the
            technology itself was very interesting, 99% of the time it was in
            the hands of bad actors.

            I started developing ideas for my final model. Going on my previous
            fun of creating "flawed mes", I brainstormed many different ideas
            that involved the creation of a false self through assumptions and
            the correction of myself through active monitoring.

            While many of these involved my physical body or my daily routines,
            they didn't feel personal - like I had a stake in the situation. The
            idea that really captured my attention though involved AI art. With
            the sudden rise of AI art generation through DALL-E and Midjourney,
            my hobby as an artist on Twitter has seen numerous ups and downs
            with human artists constantly fighting against "AI Artists" (those
            air-quotes should show where I stand in this conversation). At the
            time, I held the opinion that my art getting trained was inevitable
            and I couldn't really do much to fight it. I do hold a generally
            negative opinion over AI art generation but I really don't involve
            myself in online discourse due to my current lack of knowledge over
            the topic, though I have dabbled a bit in Stable Diffusion and
            DALL-E to stay aware of the technology.

            My plan was to gather a collection of art I've drawn so that I could
            train a Stable Diffusion style LORA to generate bootleg versions of
            my own art. I would then train a second image recognition model
            using Teachable Machine with my art and AI generated art to see if
            my recognition model could detect if art inputted was drawn by me or
            not. AI counter-programs like Glaze and Nightshade always interested
            me, and I knew of other AI image detectors but I was curious as to
            how accurate they could be. With this concept in place, I was ready
            for feedback from my peers.

            art in a specific (person's) style, or if AI can be tricked into
            believing an AI generated work is original artwork...? There could
            be lots of debate on that...unless this is a feature that already

            believe that some AI out there would be able to read the metadata of
            images.

            With critique in mind, I began work on training my first model, with
            classes all being workdays from this point on. I already had Stable
            Diffusion web UI, a free interface for Stable Diffusion that runs
            locally, installed from previous AI escapades, so my first step was
            to gather and label my training dataset.

            To keep the style consistent, I decided to pick around 50 drawings
            from 2022-2023 to train off of. I also knew that any more images
            would make the training process exponentially longer and I was also
            curious as to how accurate the model could be on a small dataset.
            Because of how model training works though, I did still have to
            train off a base style checkpoint, in my instance Anything 3.0,
            along with whatever base Stable Diffusion was trained on, which made
            me feel conflicted about this step. I was going about training my
            style LORA ethically by only using my art, but the fact that I still
            had to use others' work as a basis unsettled me slightly.

            The next step was using inbuilt tools to label my art. Since
            Anything 3.0 was trained using booru (image boards, often used for
            anime content) tags, I would have to do the same using BLIP
            captioning. The process was simple, I just had to throw my images
            in, tweak some numbers, and wait for the program to process
            everything. Roughly 30 minutes later and my images were done, and
            the results were pretty surprising. Overall the tags were fairly
            accurate, with only one mis-gendering as a noticeable error. What
            was more significant though were some of tags. The AI seemed to need
            to mention breasts, cleavage, and large breasts, which does seem to
            follow with the average human booru tagging habits, but regardless
            was still funny to look at.

            Crawford in Atlas of AI argues that this categorization comes from
            the bias of the AI designers, giving them the role of the grand role
            of judge on their own. "Designers get to decide what the variables
            are and how people are allocated to categories. Again, the practice
            of classification is centralizing power: the power to decide which
            differences make a difference." In a similar vein, Danbooru and
            other booru sites tend to have the image tags only reviewed by the
            poster, leading to an amalgamation of everyone as the judge of their
            own uploads, who are often not the original creator.

            With tagging done, I moved on to training the model. After running
            some programs for an hour, I was met with the issue that I was just
            too broke to train a model locally. My GPU, a 4GB 1050TI, was just
            too weak and was actively rejected by the training program, which
            surprised me since I thought it would just let me run it for longer
            to achieve the same result. I ended up using a Google Colab cloud
            GPU to train my model, which ended up only taking an hour to
            complete. The entire process was well documented, which grew my
            belief that AI was actually fairly easy to train because of all the
            community built tools available.

            As the model was training, it would spit out sample images for each
            of the training epochs, and I was shocked by only the midpoint. Some
            aspects were still rough, but the model was able to capture how I
            drew eyes and separate hair strands. The training would continue to
            epoch 15, at which the influence of my style became too strong and
            began creating distortions.

            At this point I was already in a state of horror and amazement, but

            running my local install of Stable Diffusion and began generating

            Overall, the lower right quadrants of both tests looked to be the
            most accurate, but some of the minor details were more interesting
            to me. The ones at the far bottom right were actively taking full
            inspiration from some of the training pictures, such as the 2
            character composition or position of the arm. This was very
            interesting as I felt like I was finally grasping how AI "copies"
            from its dataset.

          Now that the training was done, I began to experiment with various

          up with meaningless glyphs was pretty interesting, but what was more
          concerning was the "sexification" of women in a lot of the
          generations. I could only assume that it was due to the influence of

          Like my previous explorations with Teachable Machine, getting the
          skeleton of the model trained was very simple. After noticing the 4
          "inspiration" pieces, I wanted my recognition model to be able to
          detect if

          <dl>
            <dt>- An image was my own art</dt>

            <dt>- AI Generated Art</dt>
            <dd>
              - If the AI generated art had elements of one of the 4 inspiration

        <div class="paragraph">
          I then went through and manually sorted all of my art, AI generations,
          and random other images to go in each category. Once they were all put

          in one of my sample AI generations, and…

          Success! It was able to identify the generated image as inspired by
          one of my pieces. I tested it with the rest of my categories and all
          was going well until I started running into a few false positives.
          Most of the time if it was AI art, the model was able to tell what it
          was inspired from but the main source of false positives came from
          incorrectly identifying generated art as my own. I assume this was
          likely due to the fact that I didn’t have enough of my own art to
          supply to the dataset, so instead I continued to generate even more
          images to help improve the accuracy.

          There was an immediate issue. While the final result was the same

          output were slightly different. Further testing yielded even stranger
          results. The same image in both interfaces would give me completely

          Upon further investigation, I found that it was due to Teachable
          Machine’s resizing and cropping of images to 224x224px for training
          and detection, whereas my interface would detect based on the full
          image. Copying the cropped image from Teachable into my interface
          would end up yielding the same result.

        <div class="paragraph">

          Specifically, even though I was resizing the image before it was
          recognized, it still wasn’t detecting that change for the final
          output. Even if that did work, p5.js’s downscaling was different than
          Teachable Machine’s which would still lead to different results.
          Overall, compared to around 95% with Teachable, I only had a 70%
          accuracy rating with my own interface, and 100 more images in the
          dataset didn’t help.

          Overall, I was actually fairly surprised at the strengths of AI when
          it came to the generation aspect of the project. The fact that it only
          took 50 images to replicate my style was astonishing and quite
          violating. I was wondering how much it really needed, because I read
          that some LORAs could even accurately copy characters at 10-15 images.
          The accuracy of the AI detection model also surprised me a bit, but I
          did know on a pixel-by-pixel analysis, there is an inherent quality
          about AI artwork that makes it easy to detect that isn’t easily seen
          by the human eye. The inaccuracy across Teachable Maschine and ml5.js
          was also slightly surprising, with results varying wildly even though
          it was the same image at different resolutions.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          In general, AI affordances tended to push me towards feeding it more
          and more training data to create a more accurate result, which was
          primarily noticed with Teachable Machine. The inherent loss of control
          when the final outcome was spit out and the specifics of the training
          data used (images, resolution, colors) also encouraged a lot of
          fiddling with different aspects of AI in order to get it to behave how
          you want. This was also reflected in my use of Stable Diffusion, where
          I had to run multiple epoch/strength tests to see what version of my
          model produced the most stable results.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          I think the most ethical use of AI when it comes to art creation is
          just for very early concept drafting. Like the process of looking for
          reference images on websites, the AI could work to just get some very
          basic ideas out but in the end, the artist will still input most of
          the work. Otherwise, I feel like using AI later in the process leads
          to “non-authentic work” from an artist.

            how I have a preference for drawing neutral faced women. I do think
            in this aspect, AI is an interesting way to explore what makes one’s
            art their own at a fundamental level.

            - The image recognition AI did end up misidentifying some AI
            generated images as my own, but overall, it was more due to the
            translation to ml5, since the Teachable Machine hosted version
            worked surprisingly accurately, better than some human reviewers.

            - I think the implications of counter-AI are bright. With my new
            perspective on having my art trained upon, having programs like
            Glaze and Nightshade to protect my own art, and AI image detectors
            like the one I made to protect viewers definitely help me keep peace
            of mind.

          This endeavor definitely pushed me to use Glaze and Nightshade,
          whereas before I did not feel the need to. Reading on article on
          Nightshade, I echo the statement by illustrator Eva Toorenent that,
          “It is going to make [AI companies] think twice, because they have the
          possibility of destroying their entire model by taking our work
          without our consent.” Hopefully through this push back, artists and AI
          companies will be able to come to an agreement on respecting artists'
          work, but I do feel that this problem is systemic as it extends
          further out to people not respecting artists’ in general.

          As this project was wrapping up, I happened to stumble upon something
          extremely relevant. I found that one person in a community I was in
          for a game I drew most of my art for was creating LORAs of the
          characters from the game. This immediately set me off as the
          sub-community always touted respect for creators and their work.

        <div class="paragraph">
          Looking at some of the sample images, I could already recognize
          compositions made by other fan artists. This made me suspicious, so I
          questioned the creator on where they were sourcing their dataset
          images from - official art or fan artists.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Their answer? Both.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          I am a fairly significant content creator in the community (humble
          brag), so the chance that I was part of that dataset was very likely.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">And that disgusted me.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          After all I had experienced with generating my own art, I didn’t want
          to have my work defiled by AI. And the fact that now there was “that
          guy” who I thought wouldn't exist made me angry. Adding on to this,
          these LORAs were available publicly, meaning that my work was being
          spread without my consent in a manner I didn’t appreciate.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          I didn’t want to cause a big stink in another person’s sub-community,
          but I did make sure to express my disdain for what was happening from
          my perspective as an artist. I was able to convince the creator to
          take down public access, but the response from the sub-community admin
          was appalling.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          While they weren’t in 100% support of AI art generation, the fact that
          they were still accepting it in the space despite my discomfort was
          upsetting. I had worked with this person for commissions and they had
          respected my work, but to hear them take a stance like that was
          appalling.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          I did end up downloading some of the LORAs to see what I could
          recognize from its generative outputs. While I wasn’t able to identify
          any of my own art, I did recognize copious fan art and official art
          from over the years. Like my own model based off Anything 3.0, these
          models also seemed to have some form of inherent sexualization as it
          would generate alternative costumes with more skin showing. What was
          incredibly concerning was the fact that there were LORAs of child
          characters with the same amount of sexualization, which delves into a
          completely different whole of AI image generation abuse for illegal
          pornography and highly specialized fetishes.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          With the existence of this bastardization, I was very glad I took the
          time to investigate how generative AI pulls from its dataset. While it
          isn’t “stealing” per se and artists do take reference from other art,
          the degree at which the AI pulls from source images is far too great
          for my liking.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          In addition, though the creator did relent and prevent the spread by
          privating the LORAs, I am now more aware of the limitations of AI
          image detectors with the development of my own. Though they are
          accurate, they are only so to an extent. False positives are bound to
          happen and I don’t want to make false accusations against real
          artists, so I feel as though I must tread carefully. There is also the
          ethics of having to use human generated art to train an AI image
          detector, but I feel in this case it is justified as it is to the
          benefit of the artist and there isn’t a way to replicate their work
          using the interface like an image generation model does.

          Crawford brings up that "In this sense, AI systems are expressions of
          power that emerge from wider economic and political forces, created to
          increase profits and centralize control for those who wield them."
          This current realm of AI image generation and social media artists is
          one of constant strife as artists continuously fight for fair
          ownership rights but are usually powerless against the large
          corporations who only seek to profit off their work and disrespect the
          craft of art. This goes all the way down to the average consumer
          level, where AI enthusiasts and small businesses generate without
          thought or care for the artist's role in the work or even the state of
          the final product.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Overall, my entire experience with learning more about image
          generation and identification to my eventual confrontation with "that
          one guy" was very eye opening and has lead me to take a much harder
          stance against AI image generation. Whereas before I was somewhat
          ambivalent about its existence, learning of how easy it is for someone
          to replicate my style without my consent and distribute it to make
          content I don't approve of has lead me to change my view of AI to be
          far more negative. The technology itself is still interesting and I
          did get some enjoyment out of number-fiddling but overall the amount
          of bad actors using AI currently has lead me to more actively condemn
          AI "artists".

<div class="paragraph">
  And to conclude this ramble on my ever growing hatred of the weird and twisted users of AI, I leave you a self-indicating AI generated piece from my experiments.
