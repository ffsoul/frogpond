        With the introduction of this project, I already had plans of trying to
        record something a bit more out of the ordinary. At first, I had
        considered two ideas.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Though these ideas did sound interesting, I felt like their scope was a
        bit limited and in tune to my professor's feedback, could be weirder.
        And so, I went back to the drawing board, immediately opened up Discord
        instead to check on a notification, and there I saw it.

        Much of my time has been spent by shitposting on random Discord servers,
        specifically with this emote. Several years ago a friend had introduced
        me to this emote. :naruhodo: It originated from a Bkub comic from 2017,
        to a Russian Telegram sticker pack, to a Twitch emote, to a friend’s
        discord server server - all under different names), and I proceeded to
        run with this joke until the present day.

        Similar to how it is used in Pop Team Epic, how I use it is almost
        completely opposite of what I mean. I will use the emote for any
        context, whether I'm agreeing, disagreeing, chastising, waiting, etc. In
        addition, there are many variations of the emote made by myself and
        others that I use in tandem with the original, with their use sometimes
        making even less sense. Because of this, I thought it would be
        interesting to track how I use :naruhodo: in order to see what the emote
        truly means to me.

        The emote is primarily used online on Discord and Twitter so timestamps
        and contexts are recorded when I use them. I plan on collecting all of
        the data at the end of the day as to not disturb conversation flow in
        cause I use the emote multiple times in a conversation. I have used it
        in real life on rare occasions, so for those times I will record the use
        immediately.

        I had brought up the history of the emote during discussion with my
        peers and professor, which lead to interest on the history of the emote
        even beyond my usage. Tracking the evolution of :naruhodo: across a
        longer time frame seemed interesting as I feel like it could also reveal
        more about my messaging habits in general. With this, I decided to shift
        my original collection protocol to focus on the one community I talk the
        most in, over the period of a year, taking random samples from each
        month as using all 1,000+ instances would lead to a very bloated visual.

          confusing on the tracking and parameters placed on its usage, but I am
          confident these can be clarified with further exploration. I'm
          wondering how you would track your usage in the times you do
          occasionally use it in real life. It would have to rely on memory
          rather than the data history tracked on your usage online, or would
          recording after immediate action be a large interjection.

        From peer feedback, I began looking at the scope of my project again.
        Some of the data I recorded felt a bit irrelevant to the final plot,

        protocol so that I could place higher priority on collecting other
        points of data.

        Going through the mini-lecture, I started to consider what kind of

        had, it would probably be best to use color as my indicator between
        different types of data, since the scale of my visualization would lead
        to images being nigh unidentifiable. Again, with so many points, I
        decided that a dot plot would be the best way to show my data.

        This would take years for me to complete. <br/> Then I started

      <div class="paragraph">
        I ended up finding an extension called Discrubber that allowed me to
        search my use of :naruhodo: spanning back to 2021, and download all of
        the message timestamps and contents. Minor editing to the data had to be
        done to convert it to my timezone. (and had to consider daylights
        savings time)
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I wanted to include some information on my visualization about how often

        If I had the knowledge, I might have been able to automate the process,
        but instead I ended up manually reviewing all 1.2k messages. (took a
        very LONG time, several hours). Part of me thought that I might be
        pushing the scope of my project, but the other part of me was already in
        the deep end. There was no backing down now, I would process every
        message.

        Next was determining how to classify message purpose. Since this
        information would be purely subjective, I would also have to spend
        several hours manually processing data, so I worked on finding ways to
        make the process more efficient. I started by going through every
        message in July 2023 and describing every message however I saw fit. I
        then reviewed the descriptions to try and find common themes to
        categorize messages like “bullying” and “deflecting”. I started to
        reclassify, but I realized that the words were still too long and I
        still had a few too many classes. And that’s when it dawned on me.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">It’s time for a fucking alignment chart baby.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Through careful introspection the :naruhodo: alignment chart was created
        to define my messages on a Malice x Activity scale.Each spot on the
        chart had their rating like Active Benevolence that could be shortened
        to the first letters (AB) for faster processing. The phrase word, “Heh,
        Nice” helped define the key theme of the spot, while the sample message
        and keywords helped fill in the spots that the phrase might have missed.

      <div class="paragraph">
        And with the creation of the :naruhodo: chart, I delved back into the

        Over the weekend, I played around with Rawgraphs and Observable to
        create some data visualizations. What I realized was that something
        about my data was off, both sites couldn’t read my entries correctly if
        I wanted to use specific visualizations.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Also, Observable’s documentation is dogshit and made me want to cry.

        It is very funny to see all of those points and it definitely made me
        feel validated about recording the full 1032 messages, finding that
        interesting data about myself was already emerging. I would spend a few
        more days working with Observable and while I found that the information
        that they revealed was interesting, I thought it would be confusing for
        people not in the know.

      <div class="paragraph">
        At this point, I was determined to find a way to include the full 1000+
        messages in my final visualization. This would be a tough task as many
        of the observable plots I had made ended up extremely cluttered, with no
        way of appreciating the full magnitude of 1000+ points. I had different
        ideas like basic bar graphs and bubble charts, but the two that stood
        out to me the most were

      <div class="paragraph">
        <dl>
          - A physical visualization that had each message printed on small
          strips of colored paper contained inside a large jar
        </dl>
        <dl>
          - A digital visualization that spewed out a shit ton of :naruhodo: as
          a physics simulation
        </dl>
        Although my original intent was to create an interactive digital
        experience to view my message contents, something about a physical
        manifestation of my messages enthused me greatly. I felt that the mass
        of 1000 messages can’t really be felt in a 2D visual experience as it is
        all contained with a screen. Being able to physically interact with each
        message would help show my absolute obsession and overuse of :naruhodo:.
        I also felt as if the physics simulation was a bit of a surface level
        interpretation of my overuse of the emote, so with this in mind, I
        pivoted and started developing the physical visualization

    <p3> visualization development </p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <u>honing in on an idea</u>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        In discussion with my peers, it was agreed upon that the physical
        visualization was a more compelling idea. It was suggested to separate
        the messages out into different containers in order to show the
        magnitude of each alignment. Through this, I had decided on using
        acrylic cubes, so that they could form a grid and take the shape of the
        alignment chart itself. The idea was to print and attach the alignment
        chart to the back of each cube so that the information about each
        alignment could be included on the physical visualization so that when
        the cubes are all set together, it would form the alignment chart. To
        help tie the visualization back to :naruhodo:, I changed the strips of
        paper to laser cut cardboard :naruhodo: silhouettes. At this point, I
        had thought that the repeated alignment classification of color and
        location was unnecessary, so had decided at the time to leave the
        cardboard neutral colored.

        <img

          style ="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center"

          />
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        After another round of critique, I had run by the idea of my physical
        visualization to my professor for feedback, and was asked to try and
        encode more data into the visualization with color. The problem was that
        most of the other data I had was either fairly linear and boring to
        visualize or overwhelmingly skewed in one direction that the
        visualization would not be able to represent due to physical
        constraints. At the same time, I was questioning if users of the
        visualization would be able to interact with the interior pieces, or
        should I keep the tokens contained within the cubes. This brought on the
        idea of having the visualization serve as not only a visualization of my
        messaging personality, but also an interactive experience reproducing my
        time categorizing all of the messages with the alignment chart.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Each token would once again be assigned a color according to their
        alignment, and I would ask users of the visualization to sort the data
        out themselves in order to discover the data. Even without the tokens
        sorted through, my hope is that the weight of the 1000+ messages is felt
        through a giant pile of :naruhodo: tokens, and that the uneven
        distribution of colors would be noticeable in the pile.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The final iteration of the visualization before the creation process
        would involve:

      <div class = "paragraph">
      <dl>
        <dt>Data + aesthetic mappings:</dt>
        <dd>- Colors + position in grid to show alignment of message</dd>
        <dd>- One message = one physical token</dd>
        <dt>Geometric Objects:</dt>
        <dd>- One token represents a naruhodo</dd>
        <dd>- Acrylic cubes are the squares of the alignment chart</dd>

        <u>it's time</u>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        And so, with everything ready, I started to produce the final
        visualization.

        And it immediately started awfully. My cubes got lost in transit and I
        had to rush to order more. Oh well.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I went ahead and took the time to run material and size tests. I had the
        choice between 1/8th in. plywood or 1/16 in. cardboard, and while the
        plywood had a more premium feel, the cardboard was a much more
        economical and environmentally friendly option. I also tested sizes
        ranging from 1/4 in., 1/2 in., and ¾ in. widths, ultimately settling on
        3/4ths by doing some volume calculations and accounting for the random
        jumbling of tokens to take up extra space.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Doing some calculations, with one token taking roughly 15 seconds, it
        would take 4.3 hours to cut all the tokens.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">4.3 hours</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Yeah, no - We’re going to optimize the crap of this. I
        solved some issues with lines doubling through printing with InkScape,
        and manipulated some of my strokes to help with efficiency. I ended up
        with an estimate of about an hour which I was pretty fine with. With
        everything ready, I hit start…
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">It only took 30 minutes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">My estimate was extremely off. It worked out in the end so I guess it was a win?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Anyways, I went ahead and sorted all of my tokens into their respective
        categories so that they were ready to be dyed, making sure to inhale a
        dangerous amount of fumes during the process.

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph"><u>time to dye</u></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Next came the dyeing process. I thought it would be pretty easy - mix
        some food colors with water, let the cardboard absorb the dye, bing bang
        boom done.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">It took me 2 hours. Completely the opposite of what happened with cutting. </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        I had to spend a lot of time remixing colors since my mixes ended up
        being either too strong or too weak, but eventually I got every piece
        dyed. However, some sets ended up being too close in color so I had to
        redye them the next day.

      <div class="paragraph">At last, after several hours, I was done.</div>

        At the same time, I was working on the alignment chart graphics for the
        cubes. For the most part, it would be the same information from the
        original alignment chart but in the style of the discord client.
      </div>
      <div>
        <img

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I also added the counts for each alignment chart value, just so that
        information is easily viewable since there aren't hover options in real
        life like there are on the Observable interactive graphs.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        These would be put inside the cubes so that they could be displayed out
        the back. The original plan was to have a large :naruhodo: displayed on
        the front side, since I didn’t want to obscure any information, but
        after talking with my professor, I decided to just repeat the
        information and shift it slightly higher so that it could be mostly
        viewed over the piles of :naruhodo:.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I initially wanted to include a sample message on the backs of the cubes
        so that people with no knowledge of my messaging habits could discern
        what my alignment chart meant, but there was no good way for me to
        incorporate it into the cube without it getting hard to handle. Instead,
        I compromised by creating a separate reference sheet as a complementary
        piece to the main visualization.

        Probably could have had a better idea of what i wanted to do from the
        beginning instead of shifting so much to save time Chains were
        interesting but ended up not being implemented in the final, maybe
        spending the time to physically chain them together in a V2 that’s based
        more on my use over time?

        1. Perspectives of other users is missing, would be interesting to see
        how much my interpretation differs from the average reaction to the
        message
        <br />
        2. All of the data collected out of context could definitely be used to
        portray me in a very VERY bad light, as shown by the sample messages.

      <div class="paragraph">
        A lot of the data I had collected manually, such as chains, message
        contents, and message placement ended up not being used in my final
        visualization. While that content was interesting to track and learn
        about, I wish I had planned out my protocol better earlier so that I
        didn't end up spending time manually recording so much data.
