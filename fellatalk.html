            Austin Design Cohort. </br> <i>Where are my Fellas?</i></p4>
    </div>


    <p4>
        <div class="paragraph">


            As we've studied at UT, my peers and I have had less time to connect as we have split off to study different
            topics. This split has made classes less engaging and critique less helpful as I feel strong critiques come
            from friends "shooting the shit" because we have a pre-established level of trust and respect with each
            other.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Some attempts were made to bring students together in our cohort, but they were unsuccessful due to their
            rigid, work-like structures. In layman's terms, these meetings felt <b2>"too lame"</b2> to attend as they didn't feel
            like a reprieve to our normal schedules.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            As part of an Independent Study course, I held meetings with several of my peers over the semester to learn
            what makes a meeting fun and not an obligation and to avoid the "corporate lameness" of
            university-proctored events.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The most important goal though was to have an excuse to get together, make cool stuff, and create memories.
            If these meetings weren't fun, they lost their way. We were here to build our relationships as <b2>Fellas
            </b2> and have fun just <b2>talking</b2>. A Fella Talk if you will.

            gather information from members </br> <i>Gathering the Fellas</i></p4>
    </div>

    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            Professor Ploehn recommended that I hold a Low-Fidelity meeting without any of the components I wanted to
            test so I could gauge user interest from my members. After all, if I ran activities that only I was
            interested in, this gathering wouldn't be equal or fun.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <b2>Structure Discussion</b2> - The first structure of Fella Talk involved a critique round table where
            everyone presents work, and a printing demo to create a new stamp for the week.  This way, I thought I could
            provide an equal experience to everyone, while also making it worthwhile as a learning experience.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <b2>Critique</b2> - The main concern with the critique portion was that people wouldn't always have work to
            show. In addition, we only had 1.5 hours to hold our meetings which wasn't enough time to go through even
            just six people. Following Henry's advice and fella feedback, we shifted to announcing work to present ahead
            of time in a group chat and asked that members contribute to discussions but didn't demand a showcase.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <b2>Print</b2> - Half of the fellas that I had selected had already learned most of the print lessons I
            wanted to show, while the others had barely touched the lab. This created a power imbalance with some
            members inevitably turning to teaching roles for those not in the know. As a suggestion by members, we
            instead focused on a relatively simple printing method - stamp block carving. This method was fairly easy to
            learn, low-cost, and quick to clean up, which fit into the structure of our proposed meeting nicely.

                easier to inform everyone through a digital invitation instead. In addition, any changes could be sent

                    the
                    intended tone can cause initial discomfort as guests need to adjust themselves into a fitting

                    How a host holds themselves through a meeting contributes greatly to the overall enjoyment. You are
                    the one inviting people together, so you have a responsibility to provide a good time by<b2>

                    I didn't want technology to distract from meetings, but someone still needed to check time and be
                    "that guy" (usually me) when a section went on for too long. Written agendas were suggested so
                    everyone shared an <b2>equal awareness and responsibility</b2> staying on track of time. These cards also
                    served as a reminder of what was happening in that meeting. For my runs of Fella Talk, I had
                    printed cards for each person, but I think a single larger agenda in the middle of the table could
                    work just as well.

                    I had included random icebreaker questions on each agenda card in case there was any dead space in
                    the conversation. My thought was that the mystery of what question was going to be asked could help
                    bring life back to dead air, but my guests never needed to use them other than trying them at the
                    first meeting.

                        to. I modified the agenda cards to have an explicit notes section so that it could be passed
                        down later, but overall the addition did not see much use. Sticky notes would likely be a better
                        alternative since one could pass multiple notes out to presenters instead of the single note
                        card.

                    Guest archetypes may become evident across multiple meetings, especially in group discussions.
                    Ratios of

                    <b2>Talkers</b2> are generally extroverts, speaking up with many points, and often start talking over
                    each other.
                    They are the bread and butter of a conversation and help <b2>keep it running strong</b2>.

                <div style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                    <b2>Thinkers</b2> are more introverted, staying quiet and listening for a chance to chime in with a
                    deep thought.
                    They serve to shift the perspective of a conversation and <b2>open it to new ideas</b2>.

                    Take care to notice these groups emerge and cater to their needs. Most often, thinkers feel

                    they don't have the space to enter a conversation, so consider offering ways to help them interject

                    their thoughts.

            The carving half of the meeting was universally enjoyed. It would only take a few minutes to teach guests how to use the tools, but they were soon engaged. Everyone was always excited to come back for the next meeting to continue carving, which also served as an extra way to have guests self-proctor time usage.

                    Two more archetypes may appear during meetings that serve to disturb meetings. It is a host's

                Some people may have to leave earlier than others, which is where easy-outs can come in handy. These can

                With endings being just as memorable as openings, I wanted to use the act of stamping to enhance guest's experiences. I provided a stamp book that logged attendance for each meeting to serve as an activity to end the event, a way out for people leaving early, and a memento for after the meeting. Though many forgot theirs multiple times, the ones that did have theirs greatly enjoyed stamping before leaving and said it contributed to their enjoyment of the event.

                    <b2>The Classroom</b2>
                     was sealed off which gave guests a nice sense of privacy but the lack of windows, spread-out tables, and harsh lighting, coupled with the educational nature of the room made it feel uncomfortable. This room fit its role as a classroom but worked against our intents.

                 <div style="paragraph">
                     <b2>The Design Lab</b2>
                      was a familiar venue to all guests, with open windows and greenery contributing to a calming space. However, the open room allowed for chumps to invade the space, creating distractions and sometimes making the room unavailable.

                      was a temporary spot formed in an exhibition space. It's warm, dim lighting and small, enclosed space created a very intimate experience akin to a dinner party.                   </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of everything that goes into planning an event, from invitation to ending. Through readings and several Fella Talks held throughout the semester, I worked with my guests directly to help craft an experience that <b2>we all benefited from</b2>.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            My guests all benefited from extra feedback on projects. Several had peer reviews in classes that didn't meet their expectations, and Fella Talk was able to provide them. They all felt like they <b2>grew closer</b2> through the talks through the shared activity of carving. Most important though, is that <b2>they all had fun. </b2>       </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
            This project has given me a deeper understanding of interactions between members of small communities. Through several tests with numerous variables, I've been able to capture a glimpse of what drives get-togethers and how to run them well. With the design program at UT ever-expanding, I hope to pass my experiences from this study in a manner that's accessible to a newcomer to the field.         </div>

            Why write a booklet over just sharing the learnings through the case study?

        <div class="paragraph">
            While one could read the same texts that I did, I'm of the belief that making the supposed barrier of entry to holding meetings as small as possible should be the goal of my research. As opposed to longer texts, I aimed to keep my page count low and my words simple to <b2>make the idea of starting a meeting less intimidating</b2>, in hopes that more people make that first step. </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                While the best information will come from people doing their own research on their groups, I hope that my own experiments and broad advice can serve new hosts well in guiding their first meetings.</div>
