            Austin Design Cohort. </br> <i>Where are my Fellas?</i></p4>
    </div>


    <p4>
        <div class="paragraph">


            As we've studied at UT, my peers and I have had less time to connect as we have split off to study different
            topics. This split has made classes less engaging and critique less helpful as I feel strong critiques come
            from friends "shooting the shit" because we have a pre-established level of trust and respect with each
            other.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Some attempts were made to bring students together in our cohort, but they were unsuccessful due to their
            rigid, work-like structures. In layman's terms, these meetings felt <b2>"too lame"</b2> to attend as they didn't feel
            like a reprieve to our normal schedules.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            As part of an Independent Study course, I held meetings with several of my peers over the semester to learn
            what makes a meeting fun and not an obligation and to avoid the "corporate lameness" of
            university-proctored events.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The most important goal though was to have an excuse to get together, make cool stuff, and create memories.
            If these meetings weren't fun, they lost their way. We were here to build our relationships as <b2>Fellas
            </b2> and have fun just <b2>talking</b2>. A Fella Talk if you will.

            gather information from members </br> <i>Gathering the Fellas</i></p4>
    </div>

    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            Professor Ploehn recommended that I hold a Low-Fidelity meeting without any of the components I wanted to
            test so I could gauge user interest from my members. After all, if I ran activities that only I was
            interested in, this gathering wouldn't be equal or fun.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <b2>Structure Discussion</b2> - The first structure of Fella Talk involved a critique round table where
            everyone presents work, and a printing demo to create a new stamp for the week.  This way, I thought I could
            provide an equal experience to everyone, while also making it worthwhile as a learning experience.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <b2>Critique</b2> - The main concern with the critique portion was that people wouldn't always have work to
            show. In addition, we only had 1.5 hours to hold our meetings which wasn't enough time to go through even
            just six people. Following Henry's advice and fella feedback, we shifted to announcing work to present ahead
            of time in a group chat and asked that members contribute to discussions but didn't demand a showcase.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph2">
            <b2>Print</b2> - Half of the fellas that I had selected had already learned most of the print lessons I
            wanted to show, while the others had barely touched the lab. This created a power imbalance with some
            members inevitably turning to teaching roles for those not in the know. As a suggestion by members, we
            instead focused on a relatively simple printing method - stamp block carving. This method was fairly easy to
            learn, low-cost, and quick to clean up, which fit into the structure of our proposed meeting nicely.

                easier to inform everyone through a digital invitation instead. In addition, any changes could be sent

                    as
                    classrooms as a place for study, or parks as a place of relaxation. A venue that is dissonant with
                    the
                    intended tone can cause initial discomfort as guests need to adjust themselves into a fitting
                    mindset for
                    the meeting, rather than one fitting of the space.

                    I didn't want technology to distract from meetings, but someone still needed to check time and be
                    "that guy" (usually me) when a section went on for too long. Written agendas were suggested so
                    everyone shared an <b2>equal awareness and responsibility</b2> staying on track of time. These cards also
                    served as a reminder of what was happening in that meeting. For my runs of Fella Talk, I had
                    printed cards for each person, but I think a single larger agenda in the middle of the table could
                    work just as well.

                    I had included random icebreaker questions on each agenda card in case there was any dead space in
                    the conversation. My thought was that the mystery of what question was going to be asked could help
                    bring life back to dead air, but my guests never needed to use them other than trying them at the
                    first meeting.

                        to. I modified the agenda cards to have an explicit notes section so that it could be passed
                        down later, but overall the addition did not see much use. Sticky notes would likely be a better
                        alternative since one could pass multiple notes out to presenters instead of the single note
                        card.

            The carving half of the meeting was universally enjoyed. It would only take a few minutes to teach guests how to use the tools, but they were soon engaged. Everyone was always excited to come back for the next meeting to continue carving, which also served as an extra way to have guests self-proctor time usage.

                    Two more archetypes may appear during meetings that serve to disturb meetings. It is a host's
                    responsibility to keep them in line, such as asking them to stay engaged, or removing them from the
                    group if need be.

                    forces people to <b2>split their attention</b2> in an extra direction.

               -  Holding single-run groups with random members held interesting results. Since most people didn't know each other, they would stay fairly silent and the host had to take the lead to prompt discussion. More meetings could improve the relations between people but for single-run events, it's better to invite friend groups.

            Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of everything that goes into planning an event, from invitation to ending.

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            My guests all benefited from extra feedback on projects. Several had peer reviews in classes that didn't meet their expectations, and Fella Talk was able to provide them. They all felt like they <b2>grew closer</b2> through the talks through the shared activity of carving. Most important though, is that <b2>they all had fun. </b2>       </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
            This project has given me a deeper understanding of interactions between members of small communities. Through several tests with numerous variables, I've been able to capture a glimpse of what drives get-togethers and how to run them well. With the design program at UT ever-expanding, I hope to pass my experiences from this study in a manner that's accessible to a newcomer to the field.         </div>
