    <p3> GUNKing it up</p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        This showcase consists of a project and its continuation in another
        project in the same class. The first project asked for the creation of a
        health and beauty brand, requiring research into the markets we wanted
        to target. The second project involved creating a brand guide, and I
        chose to expand upon my brand in the first project.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        In these 2 projects, I decided to create an anomaly in the space of ‚Äúno
        nonsense‚Äù hair and skincare brands. This led to the creation of GUNK, a
        straight forward brand targeting newcomers with a tongue in cheek
        attitude., standing out from its competitors with its neon green main
        color.

    <p3> Illuminating on GUNK</p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        We were first tasked with going through the Illumination process to help
        hone the goal of our brand, making sure to go through six steps:
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph" style="text-indent: 0px;">
        - Identity - What do I know?
        <br />
        - Personality - What image will I project?
        <br />
        - Audience - Who am I talking to?
        <br />
        - Research - What are the unknowns?
        <br />
        - Requirements - What are the parameters?
        <br />
        - Results - What are the final expectations?
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        What I had found was that established no fluff brands like The Ordinary
        still had too much fluff in some ways, but also too much simplicity as
        it became hard to distinguish separate products from a glance. These
        brands also tended to have an air of maturity and elegance around them
        which I felt would alienate my audience of young newcomers to the world
        of hair and skincare. Because of this, I wanted to toy with the
        expectation of the audience by giving my brand a snarky attitude and
        bright colors to contrast with the other brands on shelves.

        Once that was finished, I moved on to the next stage of Illumination to
        help build overall themes and aesthetics for my brand. A mind map, word
        list, mood board, and reversing were utilized to help establish how I
        wanted to present my brand visually.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        My vision for the brand was to take inspiration from the neon greens of
        Hi-C Ecto Cooler to catch attention and mix it with the clear packaging
        of Nickelodeon Slime containers to show that our brand has nothing to
        hide.

    <p3> Getting my GUNK on</p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I then moved on to sketching out logo concepts for GUNK. At this point,
        I wasn‚Äôt entirely set on a name so I focused primarily on pictorial and
        mascot logos, with the idea that I would have a frog as the mascot for
        GUNK.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guSketch.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        Though I had many good ideas, and I received feedback for what I had at
        the time, I felt like I had strayed too far from my original vision for
        GUNK. All of these logos added too much fluff to the brand so I had to
        decide between abandoning my no-fluff principle or shifting my logo
        designs in a different direction on the next phase of logo drafting.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        In the end, I ended up changing how I approached my logo design. As I
        moved on to refined sketches, I ended up focusing on making wordmarks
        since I had settled on GUNK as the name for my brand.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guRefine.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        My goal this time was to make logos that were bold but not menacing,
        which involved heavy weighted characters with rounded corners to ease
        some of the tension from the design. Incorporation of more simple shapes
        was also considered to try and make the logo as straight to the point as
        possible, along with shifting away from frogs as they distracted from
        the main purpose of the brand.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        The modular characters in the highlighted sketch really stuck with me
        during the sketching process, which lead me to create a few more
        iterations of the letterforms. The similarity between letters helped the
        logo read as one large block of color, which I thought would work well
        for getting customer attention when viewed on a store shelf. This and
        the opportunities for other letterforms in a similar style led me to
        continue developing on this sketch.

    <br />
    <p3> Cleaning up the GUNK</p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The next step in this project was to bring my sketches into Illustrator
        and start vectorizing my logos. I developed multiple versions of a base
        form for my letters, slowly flattening the top arch across each
        generation. I wished to show a sense of fluidity in my logo since the
        brand would sell oils and creams, which was done by manipulating a
        teardrop shape into a counter. This shape would continue to be used on
        other letters in GUNK to help keep it cohesive.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guLogoDev1.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        I played around with different formats of how the 4 letters would be
        laid out. I tried to keep the original 2x2 grid design but making sure
        it would be read in the correct order and still looked nice proved to be
        challenging, so I decided to line up the characters horizontally
        instead. This would make me realize that the logo could potentially be
        perceived as CUNK, which lead to tweaking the G so that it reads easier.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guLogoDev2.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        Here, I also experimented with how type would play with my logo. I
        wanted something that could still stand on its own while also being able
        to recede in the presence of the main logo.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guTypeface.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        The final part of the first project was putting it all together. I stuck
        with a 3 color brand system with green as the primary color, but the
        off-black and white can pair with any other color if a new product line
        would call for changing the green. I also kept some of the previous
        iterations of the logo as alternative formats for different sized
        packaging.
      </div>
    </p4>
    <br />
    <p3> Branding for GUNK</p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I would decide to revisit GUNK for my final project to create a brand
        deck in Images in Communications. My main goal was to take the
        information from my original presentation and showcase it in a way that
        best expressed my brand‚Äôs identity. A full green background was used to
        help portray GUNK‚Äôs bold attitude.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guBreakdown.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        Different display options of the logo were showcased, showing how and
        when to use alternate logo formats for GUNK. GUNK‚Äôs accompanying color
        palette and typefaces were also shown.
      </div>
      <img
        class="banner"
        src="assets/images/gunk/guSecondary.png"
      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        Mockups were made to show how the logo is to be used, making sure to
        balance the presence of the logo and the secondary information to help
        the product be read more easily.
      </div>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; padding-top: 10px">
    
       <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">

      />
    </div>
    </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Example social media graphics were set up to show how GUNK would market
        itself, focusing on solo shots of their products on flat backgrounds for
        a ‚Äúthis is what you get‚Äù feel.

    <p3> Reflecting on GUNK</p3>
    <p4>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Overall, I felt this project was a great success! I thought that I was
        able to try designing in a direction that I don‚Äôt often do, while also
        still incorporating some of my ‚Äúglobby frog weirdness‚Äù with the fluid
        letterforms and snarky personality. There are still some slides in my
        brand deck that I would like to reformat for better clarity such as the
        type and pattern slides, but I feel that the deck does very well at
        communicating what my brand is and my brand‚Äôs personality without
        overshadowing the actual content.
