            Students regularly walk past green areas on their way to class
            without ever thinking about what goes on in those secluded spaces.
            So much can be found in there, from organisms you never would have
            thought would be on campus to the considerable amount of waste left
            behind. To help bring appreciation to the flora and fauna of UT, I
            created a physical interface to help users get into the mindset of a
            dwelling “gremlin”, cast themselves away from society, and go on an
            exploration in the hidden pits of UT.

    <h3>Project Overview (Will Rewrite later)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently, past our freshman year of the design program, our cohort has become incredibly divided as we explore different aspects of design, with our work ending up forgotten about beyond the period of the class.</li>
      <li>Explore the role of grassroots organizations in developing a propensity to share current and past work outside of class contexts for feedback and critique, using the UT design cohort for small-scale tests.</li>
      <li>Use print as an artifact and print as an activity in various user tests and workshops over the semester to discover how it can be used to encourage the sharing of work or as a vessel of discussion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Post Project Reflection (TBA)</h3>
    <h3>“Where are my friends?”</h3>
    <p>I thought about this a lot over the last 2 semesters. After I got to know everyone in my year in the intro design classes, the student base split to focus on specific design roles or worked toward a minor. This was… kind of a shame really since I think good design revolves around getting a good group of buddies who know you well enough to critique you properly. While there are those kinds of outspoken critics in most classes, a lot of the time the class has mixed student years, leading to a hesitance to give stronger critique due to unfamiliarity and differences in design skills. My strongest critiques have been from sitting with my friends and “shooting the shit” because we all have a pre-established level of trust and respect with each other.</p>
    <p>
      Moreover - classes just kind of sucked if there weren’t many people who I was already friends with. Of course, when working in design out of college, you’ll likely be shifting between clients and groups, but there will still
      <em>probably</em>
      be a static group you can mingle with. Meanwhile, the design program’s structure inadvertently ends up separating people from their different design interests. With this and the chaotic scheduling of design classes, I ended up not seeing many of my friends recently, and with the ones I did see, I would only see brief glimpses of their work. And man - that really sucked.</p>
    <p>There were some attempts to gather students in the past which had mixed results. Our chapter of AIGA felt like it was too large for close discussion. The Friendsgiving Potlucks I held were too grand to hold consistently. What I wanted was a regularly meeting small group that could meet up and just
      <em>talk</em>
      - about designs we worked on, about the program, about whatever really. Something low-key and low-stress just to make it feel more intimate than some of the larger organizations. With all of this thought, I decided to focus this study on developing the “grassroots small community” idea that I yearned for, so that I could make a space to share design work and set time aside to just talk with my fellas. A “Fella Talk” if you will.</p>
    <p>I did want to include my current obsession with print into this somehow, and in the most superficial way to explain it, “i thought it would be pretty neat, lol,” (which would come to bite me in the butt when fleshing this idea out). While I do HEAVILY enjoy using technology, there is beauty in interacting with a physical object. My time drawing art and my summer spent working on the RRK Folio and Personal Project Residency would grow my love for creative print work that I wanted to share. Despite our program having an entire printing lab and classes revolving around it, most others never really touched it which I think is a missed opportunity and a massive bummer.</p>
    <p>I think it’s important to note that I take the perspective of a self-proclaimed “Most Extroverted Introvert”, with most of my free time spent indoors locked away in my room. I go out with friends sometimes, but for the most part, I don’t do much in person outside of class, to the point that I think I’m kind of bad at socializing. Take that as you will while I talk about my own experiences in growing my group of fellas.</p>

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>Before the semester I read
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
        <em>The Art of Gathering</em>
      </span>
      <em></em>by Priya Parker and
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
        <em>Community: The Structure of Belonging</em>
      </span>
      by Peter Block.
      <em>The Art of Gathering</em>
      was notably influential as I ended up binge-reading it across two sessions. If I were to go over everything, I’d essentially be writing a condensed version of the book so I’ll throw down what I’ve learned as it becomes relevant to my findings.
      <strong>(this part sounds kind of dumb)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>My running proposal for this independent study talks about using print as an artifact and print as an activity to help foster communication. However, I could not for the life of me figure out how to incorporate these two cleanly and balance them with time for critique, lest I try and multitask too hard and lose sight of my original goal for the group.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I soon had my first check-in with Professor Ploehn, my mentor for this independent study, where I talked about what I’ve read and my goals for the semester.&nbsp; As a base structure, I wanted to plan meetings around notable points of collective pain and suffering in the year to help give them a chance to unwind. I already had a rough schedule planned out, but I was recommended to run a crappy low-stakes meeting to see what I could air out before settling on my structure. Notably, she had suggested running this meeting without the print component, so that I could figure out I could mesh it all together. Keeping this advice in mind, I set out to start creating this community with my first step - gathering the members.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Gathering People</h4>
    <p>
      <em>The Art of Gathering</em>
      brings in the concept of “Bobs'' in a community. Bobs aren’t actively antagonistic, instead just existing within the group. However, by just existing in the space, they detract from the group experience since each person has to stretch their attention out to an extra member whom they might not be particularly interested with. Being aware of this, I decided to go with a suggested size of 6 people for my curated group of fellas. Having more people could be nice, but there was the looming risk of critiques going too long and stretching the experience to boredom.</p>
    <p>With that settled, I started sending out messages to my friends to see if they were interested. There was a weird, almost imposter syndrome-like feeling I had when reaching out like this. Who was I, just an average student, going out of my way to make a group, were people responding just because they wanted to help me with my projects - all of that nonsense? While I can’t deny there isn’t a bit of a tilted dynamic with me as the host and researcher that could make the experience feel less genuine, it’s a tough hurdle that one person needs to jump over so that groups can form, instead of constantly waiting for somebody to start something else.</p>
    <p>Hearing back from people, I soon ran into my next problem - those chaotic design student schedules were an absolute pain to work around. Everyone’s schedules ran into each other, leaving few comfortable times to meet.&nbsp; I was eventually able to settle on Thursday afternoons to meet as most people were finished for the week and it could serve as a nice unwinding experience. Regardless, this experience spoke of another one of the barriers faced when trying to organize communities. Even if everyone was willing, the layering of schedules adds more complexity to the host’s job. I had wanted to include some other bonding moments like walking around and eating as part of this meetup, but I only had around 1.5 hours to work with so I had to make the most of what I had.</p>
    <p>Host energy and the touch of stupid</p>
    <h3>Prepping for the fellas</h3>
    <p>
      In her book, Priya says that a gathering has started before everyone has even met up. The expectations surrounding the gathering excite people for what could come next and can have a great impact on how the rest of the event goes. This idea goes down to the root of a gathering - the invitation. I think physical invitations are special; they serve as memories of events in ways similar to movie tickets or commemorative photos. Digital invites, while convenient, just don’t hold the same value. Wanting to get my hands dirty with some designing, I went ahead and started to draft an invite that would set the tone for my meetings.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      The overall goal of the meetings was to be a time to chill and share our work. There was time for us to be students while critiquing each other, but ultimately I wanted people to loosen up and get a bit goofy with their stamp carvings. To channel this energy into the invite, I decided to draw out the entire invite in a childish and silly style, with crayon strokes and little doodles.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>(image of invite here)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire invite design process boiled down to spur-of-the-moment, “what I thought was most fun” decisions, of course with some consideration of layout and hierarchy to make sure information was conveyed clearly. Even the name, “Fella Talk”, was something that just came to me.&nbsp; It was something that just sounded stupid, which in combination with the rest of the invite made the tone of these talks clear. Something like “Critique and Stamp Carving Workshop” would give off a completely different and serious idea for the meeting. Fella Talk’s goal was to be an “injection of stupidity” into the design student life where we could take a break from the structure of classes.</p>
    <p>
      Fella Talk needed a place to meet. I had considered holding meetings in empty classrooms, but going off
      <em>The Art of Gathering</em>, I avoided them because the venue gave very “serious and clinical energy”, which went against the casual nature of my event. I instead looked towards our university’s Design Lab. It was one of the most “designerly” spaces on campus and was much more inviting, partly because the room had natural daylight and plants. People were already familiar with the space as they would wait there between classes and it was in a central and accessible place on campus, so I decided first Fella Talk would be held in the lab.</p>
    <p>
      With the design finalized, I printed out my invites and handed them out to the members. From what I saw, people did seem to appreciate being handed something physical</p>
