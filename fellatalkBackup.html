                    Currently, past our freshman year of the design program, the design cohort at UT Austin has become
                    incredibly divided as we explore different aspects of design, with our work ending up forgotten
                    about beyond the period of the class. My goal was to explore the role of grassroots organizations in
                    developing a propensity to share current and past work outside of class contexts for feedback and
                    critique, using the UT design cohort for small-scale tests. Through the use print as an artifact and
                    print as an activity, I conducted various user tests and workshops over the semester to discover how
                    print can be used to encourage the sharing of work or as a vessel of discussion. A final document
                    was created to share the ideas that I learned on a broader spectrum that others could take and apply
                    to their own communities.

            To lay it out plainly, organizations set up by administration are inherently "less cool." I feel the
            rigidity and importance of it all locks down chances to make deeper connections with others. As part of an
            independent study with Cathryn Ploehn, I set out to study and define a "Fella Talk", my own version of what
            a niche micro-organization should embody, and write a guide so others could learn how to structure the
            communities they wanted to hold.
        </p4>
    </div>

    <p3>"Where are my Fellas?"</p3>
    <p4>
        <div class="paragraph">
            I thought about this a lot over the last 2 semesters. After I got to know everyone in my year in the intro
            design classes, the student base split to focus on specific design roles or worked toward a minor. This was…
            kind of a shame really since I think good design revolves around getting a good group of buddies who know
            you well enough to critique you properly. While there are those kinds of outspoken critics in most classes,
            a lot of the time the class has mixed student years, leading to a hesitance to give stronger critique due to
            unfamiliarity and differences in design skills. My strongest critiques have been from sitting with my
            friends and “shooting the shit” because we all have a pre-established level of trust and respect with each
            other.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Moreover - classes sucked if there weren’t many people who I was already friends with. The design program’s
            structure inadvertently separates people from their different design interests. With this and the chaotic
            scheduling of design classes, I ended up not seeing many of my friends recently, and with the ones I did
            see, I would only see brief glimpses of their work. And man was this socially isolating.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Some attempts to gather students in the past had mixed results. Our chapter of AIGA felt too large for close
            discussion. The Friendsgiving Potlucks I held were too grand to hold consistently. What I wanted was a
            regularly meeting small group that could meet up and just talk - about designs we worked on, the program,
            whatever really. Something low-key and low-stress just to make it feel more intimate than some of the larger
            organizations. With all of this, I decided to focus this study on developing the “grassroots small
            community” idea that I yearned for, so that I could make a space to share design work and set time aside to
            just talk with my fellas. A “Fella Talk” if you will.


        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I did want to include my current obsession with print into this somehow, and in the most superficial way to
            explain it, “i thought it would be pretty neat, lol,” (which would come to bite me in the butt when fleshing
            this idea out). While I do HEAVILY enjoy using technology, there is beauty in interacting with a physical
            object. My time drawing art and my summer working on the RRK Folio and Personal Project Residency would grow
            my love for creative print work that I wanted to share. Despite our program having an entire printing lab
            and classes revolving around it, most others never really touched it which I think is a missed opportunity
            and a massive bummer.


        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            It’s important to note that I take the perspective of a self-proclaimed “Most Extroverted Introvert”, with
            most of my time spent locked away in my room. I sometimes go out, but for the most part, I don’t do much
            with others outside of class, so I had socially regressed in the past year. Not wanting to stay a hermit, I
            treated this independent study as an unapologetic excuse to hang out with my friends and learn more about
            what makes a hangout fulfilling.

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            For this independent study, I proposed using print as an artifact and print as an activity to help foster
            communication. However, I couldn’t figure out how to merge these ideas with a critique session, without
            multitasking and losing sight of my goal.

        </div>

        <img class="banner" src="assets/images/fellaTalk/MultiTrackDrifting.webp" />

        <div class="paragraph">
            I had my first check-in with Professor Ploehn, my mentor for this independent study, where I discussed my
            readings and overall project goals. As a base, I wanted to plan meetings around notable points of collective
            pain and suffering in the year to provide a chance to unwind. I had a rough schedule planned out, but I was
            recommended to run a crappy low-stakes meeting to see what I could air out before settling on my structure.
            Notably, Professor Ploehn suggested running this meeting without the print component, so I could figure out
            how to mesh it together. Keeping this advice in mind, I set out to create this community with my first step
            - gathering the members.


        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Gathering People </b></u>
        </div>

        <img class="banner" src="assets/images/fellaTalk/ArtOfGathering.jpg" />

        <div class="paragraph">
            The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker brings the concept of “Bobs'' in a community. Bobs aren’t actively
            antagonistic, instead just existing within the group. However, by just existing in the space, they detract
            from the group experience since each person has to stretch their attention out to an extra member who they
            might not be particularly interested in. Aware of this, I decided to go with a suggested size of 6 people
            for my curated group of fellas. Having more people could be nice, but there was the looming risk of
            critiques going too long and stretching the experience to boredom.



        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I started sending messages to my friends to see if they were interested. There was a weird, almost imposter
            syndrome-like feeling when reaching out like this. “Who was I to be trying to make this group?” “Were people
            responding just because they wanted to help me with my projects” While I can’t deny there isn’t a tilted
            dynamic with me as the host and researcher that makes the experience “less genuine”, it’s a tough hurdle
            that one person needs to jump over so that groups can form, instead of constantly waiting for something to
            start up.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I soon ran into my next problem - design student schedules are a pain to work around and left only a few
            time slots to meet. I settled with Thursday as I was hoping the meets would serve as a nice end cap to
            people’s school weeks, but this experience showed one of the big hurdles of organization. Even if everyone
            was willing, it adds on to the host’s work. I had wanted to include other activities, but because of the
            time constraints, I only had an hour and a half to work with.


        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            In the end, I gathered 5 other people with an assortment of design interests and print experiences to be a
            part of this initial group of fellas. Avery, Nhu, Chan, Salma, Abraham, and last but not least - Me.


        </div>

    <p3>Fella Preppin'</p3>
    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph">
            In her book, Priya says that a gathering has started before everyone has even met up. The expectations
            surrounding the gathering excite people for what could come next and can have a great impact on how the rest
            of the event goes. This idea goes down to the root of a gathering - the invitation. I think physical
            invitations are special; they serve as memories of events in ways similar to movie tickets or commemorative
            photos. Digital invites, while convenient, just don’t hold the same value. Wanting to get my hands dirty
            with some designing, I went ahead and drafted an invite that would set the tone for my meetings.

        </div>

        <img class="banner" style="width:50vw;" src="assets/images/fellaTalk/FellaTalkInvite.png" />


        <div class="paragraph">
            The overall goal of the meetings was to make time to chill and share work. There was time to be students
            during critique, but ultimately I wanted people to loosen up from their busy schedules. To channel this
            energy into the invite, I decided to draw out the entire invite by hand like a crappy kid’s doodle.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The entire invite design process boiled down to spur-of-the-moment, “what I thought was most fun” decisions,
            of course with some consideration of layout and hierarchy to make sure information was conveyed clearly.
            Even the name, “Fella Talk”, was something that just came to me. It was something that just sounded stupid,
            which in combination with the rest of the invite made the tone of these talks clear. Something like
            “Critique and Printing Workshop” would give off a completely different and serious idea for the meeting.
            Fella Talk’s goal was to be an “injection of stupidity” into the design student life where we could take a
            break from the structure of classes.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Next, Fella Talk needed a place to meet. I had considered empty classrooms, but I avoided them as they had a
            “serious and clinical energy”, which went against the casual nature of my event. I instead looked towards
            our university’s Design Lab. It was one of the most “designery” spaces on campus and was much more inviting,
            partly because the room had natural daylight and plants. The lab was also more familiar and accessible from
            all around campus since people had classes in the same building. With the base structure finalized, I
            printed out my invites and handed them out to the members.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Members seemed to appreciate being handed a physical invitation, and were surprised that they were receiving
            something before the event had even started. With this, Fella Talk 0.5 was on track to begin.
        </div>
    </p4>

    <p3>Pre-Fella Observations</p3>
    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Fella Talk 0.5 had rolled up. As I was finishing up work, the fellas made their way into our designated
            meeting space. One person was missing and after a few minutes passed, I eventually decided to call it and
            start the meeting a few minutes after scheduled. This meeting was focused on getting input for future
            meetings, so I wasn’t too concerned. With the fellas already mingling, I got ready to begin.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Space </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            This day in the lab was particularly empty. Since we wouldn’t be printing and were just discussing group
            norms going forward, I didn’t deem it too necessary to create an “alternate world” for people to enter.
            Still, I made sure that everyone sat together at the edge of the table to try and close us off from the rest
            of the lab.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Fellas </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            For critique, people were against always having to bring something to show, for a good reason - a lot of us,
            including myself, weren’t taking many project-based courses so there would be periods where we could have
            nothing to show. Ultimately, we decided that everyone didn’t need to present a work for critique, but I
            still encouraged people to bring something to show.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The time needed for critique was also up for discussion. Since we were working in a tight timeframe, I
            wondered if we needed a timer so that crits could be balanced evenly. However, members were against a timer,
            saying how it could make them feel rushed. Instead, they suggested having an agenda out on the table for
            everyone to see, taking the responsibility away from me as the timekeeper while still setting a time for
            critique. This agenda would also help to set a clear purpose for the meeting, detailing what to expect from
            the meetings so members wouldn’t be confused.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            To help plan future meets, we decided it would be best to have some kind of group chat instead of me
            scrambling to contact everyone individually. This would also help make the group feel more cohesive, even if
            I still was the one scheduling the meetings. We landed on using Instagram as our platform of choice because
            it offered a good mix of intimacy and level of engagement compared to other options like email or group
            texts.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Host </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I’m an expressive person, someone who makes themself known in a room, so obviously I gave everyone a strong
            and warm welcome before immediately falling into one of Priya’s pitfalls mentioned in her book - boring
            logistics talk. In the long run, this discussion was useful, but this was an incredibly stiff way to
            introduce what was supposed to be a fun series of meetings. Regardless, the logistics were important. Though
            I had a rough idea of how I wanted the gathering structure to go, I wanted input from the rest of the group
            so that our Fella Talks could address what they wanted out of this community.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Print </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Initially, I wanted to showcase a variety of printing methods so that we’d be doing something new each time.
            However, the group had a mix of printers and non-printers which could create disinterest and force a
            “teacher position” on them. Moreover, I would have to assume an even higher role as a lecturer, making this
            event more of a class instead of a simple hangout. Through discussion, we decided to focus on a single,
            simple form of print - linoleum block carving. It was an easy process that most people could pick up in a
            few minutes and quick enough to where one could start and finish a block within our allotted 1-hour time
            frame.

        </div>

        <img class="banner" src="assets/images/fellaTalk/fellatalkstampbook.png" />

        <div class="paragraph">
            With everything settled for now, it was time to end the meeting, and this meeting needed to end with a bang.
            To commemorate this commencement of the fellas, I elaborately threw out stamp books for everyone. The books
            had spots to stamp off when they came to meetings, and getting a stamp would serve as an informal send-off,
            giving people the chance to leave early without disrupting the group dynamic. My hope with these books is
            that it would drive a commitment to the group through a physical record of meetings, and would help to give
            a memorable conclusion to each meet. As I stamped off everyone’s books, they all seemed excited to receive a
            gift and eager to see what would come next as they headed home. Fella Talk 0.5 had come to a close and was a
            great success in gathering information. Now, I just needed to implement this and wait for the next gathering
            of the fellas…

    <p3>It's Time for a Fella Talk!</p3>
    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph">
            With the .5 meeting done and the group's norms set, it was time to hold Fella Talk! We ended up having time
            to hold 4 meetings throughout the year, and with these 3 meetings I learned plenty about group dynamics and
            the many factors that affect them.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Space </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The issue with using public spaces to hold meetings is that they aren’t always accessible. Multiple times, I
            had to move the talks to a different location because of space constraints. Fella Talk 1 was notable in that
            I had to make the change right before we started since there was too much noise in the lab to hold a good
            conversation.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Despite my best efforts, we would find ourselves in the classroom next door quite frequently. The lack of
            windows, dim lighting, and spread out tables made the space feel uncomfortable. The tables in the room were
            laid out in a U shape which separated the group the first time we used the room. Every time after, we made
            sure to either push the tables closer or sit closer in every room we used.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            There were times where we used the Design Lab in a busy environment, which did end up causing some
            disturbances. Friends from outside the Fella Talk would sometimes chime in and become Bobs. While there
            wasn’t much I could do with people hearing in, I was able to close off the table with a large box, creating
            our own smaller space within the design lab.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Overall, we did the best with the spaces we had on campus, but it would have been better if we had our own
            spot
            to hold meetings. There are some other areas where we could reserve rooms for meetings across campus, but
            they
            didn’t have the supplies we needed for our activities so we were chained to the Art Building and Design Lab.
        </div>

        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Fellas </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I had chosen fellas who had all had at least some interactions with each other, with some being much closer
            friends than others and me serving as the glue holding everyone together. Everyone always seemed excited
            coming into meets. The first meet had everyone already sitting down and talking while I was setting up,
            while at the subsequent meets, people would immediately start carving before everyone had arrived.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Critique sessions started out rough but would smooth over after the first few meetings. I had initially
            planned for people to choose to share at the meets, but the first meeting proved that if we didn’t pre-plan,
            we would quickly run out of time. Future meets would use our Instagram group chat to discuss who had
            something to bring to the table so we could alot time to each presenter. With this change, critique ran much
            smoother. There were points in discussion where 2 or 3 people seemed to dominate discussion which did lead
            to us running short on time and having to cut to the next presenter.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            There were multiple occasions where I had the chance to introduce an unfamiliar fella into the group. Nhu’s
            and Chan’s friend had shown up to a meeting where I had initially denied them, but by the time we were
            beginning to wrap up, I had brought them back in. It was clear that while some of the fellas were not put
            off by the sudden new addition, they couldn’t connect to the unfamiliar friend in the same way as the fellas
            they already knew.
        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            There was another moment when Avery was unable to come, and as a last minute addition, I had invited Colin
            to join for the day. Colin was unaware of the group norms and would frequently break away from the group
            during carving sessions, as well as not having anything prepared for critique because of the
            spur-of-the-moment decision. However, he did contribute a fair amount into discussion when he was engaged.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Host </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            While I tried to be as ready for Fella Talks as I could, sometimes my work from right before would leave me
            disheveled as fellas were entering. It was the worst at the beginning of the year while people were still
            learning about the lab for their classes, but over time I was eventually able to deal with it.

        </div>

        <img class="banner" src="assets/images/fellaTalk/FellaTalkAgenda.png" />

        <div class="paragraph">
            This time I would make sure to get attention early on with *THEATRICS* by dramatically handing out the new
            Fella Agendas. Each agenda gave us all a rough schedule to follow so we would stay on track, without that
            duty falling on one person’s shoulders. Underneath that was my surprise for the meeting, the ULTIMATE
            ICE-BREAKER. These ice-breaker questions were all incredibly unserious and were to be used if one didn’t
            have a project to share during critique, as an attempt to encourage people to bring their projects and a way
            to keep people engaged if they didn’t have anything.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            As the meetings progressed, I noticed that people waned away from using the Ice Breakers. Whether it was
            because they had other things to talk about or didn’t want to say a silly statement, the Ice Breakers had
            served their purpose well.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The theatrics are integral by the way. To keep the meeting from straying too far into feeling like an
            extension of classes, I acted like my normal exaggerated self to make sure people knew this event wasn’t
            serious. During intros and critiques, I did straighten up a bit just to help direct the flow of conversation
            but again, nothing too serious.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Print </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I had continued to create physical invites for the first few meetings since the reception was positive, but
            after the first one, I found that people weren’t reading them fully. They appreciated the gesture as it made
            them feel special but the content would sometimes be ignored. After a while, I ended up just switching to
            digital invitations.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            It was clear that everyone was highly eager to start carving once we finished critique. There was a bit of
            futzing around with the tools at the first meeting, but after everyone had everything figured out, the
            fellas got to carving right away. I had thought people would make small stamps, but people sprung to making
            images that took up the full 4x6 block as opposed to the small stamps I thought people would prefer.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Carving blocks seemed to be incredibly enthralling to the fellas - they were all obsessed with finishing and
            didn’t want to leave until they were done. I knew that people were interested in carving, but I did not
            expect how much the fellas would be into the process. But soon, one by one they had to leave, signing
            themselves out by getting their stamp books stamped (which some people always forgot). This act of print as
            a closing ceremony really helped tie the entire event together and left people excited to come to the next
            meeting and carve more.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Post Meeting Analysis </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I don’t think I had it in me to host multiple groups. Just running one was making me worried if people were
            enjoying themselves, so I wanted to focus my energy on making this one group successful. I was still open to
            testing this community structure with other people though, maybe as a one-time experience to see if my
            findings would transfer to a different group of people.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Reviewing my notes, there were definitely ways to improve the meetings. My main concern was about how people
            felt during critique time, as it seemed that some people in the group were more prone to discussion than
            others. I know that some of these fellas are more introverted, but was there anything I could do to
            encourage them to open up more? To get more information, I turned to my fellas for some interviews.
        </div>

    <p3>Fella Feedback and Reflections</p3>
    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph">
            To figure out how to cater to my Fellas’ needs, I gave a few opportunities for feedback. This group wasn’t
            meant to be run by me alone of course - What makes a community is input from everyone honed together by the
            host.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Space </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Everyone preferred the Design Lab over the classroom next door, no question. The entire room felt very
            clinical and academic, taking away from the casual experience. The closed off space did allow for a sense of
            secrecy and a chance for gossip but otherwise most would describe it as “depressing”.


        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Seating generally always took on a U shape since we usually had to stay at the edge of tables to not get in
            the way of other people using the space. The classroom’s tables were notably not all together, which ended
            up isolating the two halves of the room from connecting, and people preferred if we sat closer or moved the
            tables. The design lab’s tables were already pushed together so it was perfect for us.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The classroom’s separation from outsiders did also help with not feeling overwhelmed or watched. Some fellas
            expressed that coming in felt a bit hectic with some of the meets happening with many students working on
            projects in the Design Lab.
        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Fellas </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            The fellas all had great fun. While there were some things that could be tweaked, they all said they enjoyed
            themselves, which was reliving on my end.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I did notice some patterns in discussion forming where the group was divided between “talkers” and
            “listeners”, essentially splitting the room in half sometimes. Nhu had self-identified as a talker and would
            usually sit along with Avery and Abraham. On other hand, Chan, Salma, and I considered ourselves as
            listeners. While everyone did enjoy themselves, the talkers would end up dominating a lot of the
            conversation, which is in no way bad, but it did leave little opportunity for the listeners to pop in. There
            were some fellas who were worried that they were disturbing others or not letting them speak enough, but for
            the most part, it didn’t have a big impact during the meets.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            A thought that was brought up in the interviews was the idea of platonic and professional relationships.
            Everyone knew each other and could all call each other friends, but there was still a professional barrier
            between some members as they would only interact with each other during classes.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Host </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            At a few points during the meetings, I had to leave the room during both the critique and carving sections.
            Everyone reported that my sudden absence didn’t have a strong impact on the dynamic. Everyone was already
            comfortable enough with each other to talk without needing me to guide them.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Once I noticed my status as a listener, a lot was revealed to me that I could have done better at as a host.
            There were many times where I refrained from guiding the conversation because I didn’t want to interrupt
            someone’s thought, even if we were starting to go overtime. As a host, there is definitely a need to push
            out of my comfort zone and embody a “talker persona” to help guide conversation properly.
        </div>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Print </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Coming into the meets, everyone was already somewhat interested in print or had done it before, but I didn’t
            expect how much people would be into it. Everyone unanimously agreed that the print aspect was their
            favorite part of the meeting as it was just a time to talk while also having a fairly mindless activity to
            recede into if they didn’t feel like always engaging in conversation. The final moments of each meet where
            everyone would print copies of their carvings for each other were a notable highlight point.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            People really appreciate being given physical invites at first, although interest in them seemed to wane the
            further we went into the year. Nhu specifically was already biased against me since she already receives a
            lot of printed work from me, so it seems printed material is best used as an initial hook. The printed
            agendas were always appreciated though, making sure the meetings stayed on time.

            <u><b> Henry Interview </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            I also took the chance to interview our Design Lab Manager, Henry, about his experiences hosting his own
            crit clubs. After graduating he and others found that they wanted to build a space for critique outside of
            class, as well as just wanting an excuse and motivator to make cool things. Like the ideals I wanted to
            embody in my Fella Talks, these were fairly small events between friends which held a balance of working
            critique and relaxing social play.

        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <b> Misc. Tips from the Interview </b>

        <div class="paragraph">
            An important note I wanted to highlight was that the first-time host discomfort seemed to be a shared
            experience. It’s a big task to start up a new community, but as time goes on you become more comfortable in
            your role.

    <p3>Suddenly, New Fellas!</p3>
    <p4>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Since the beginning, I wanted to run a second group of fellas, but I felt it would be too much for me to
            coordinate considering how hard it was to find a good time for everyone at the first Fella Talk group - not
            to mention the amount of carving blocks I’d have to buy. At some point, I ran this idea with my friend
            Gabby, which led to running several one-off “Rando” Talks with random groups to see how applicable some of
            my findings were to larger audiences. Would some of the structures set in place work within an uncontrolled
            and unknowing group? Who knows? Let’s try it out.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Space </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Rando Talks ended up being held in various places like the Design Lab during both on and off hours, as well
            as Gabby’s exhibition space. Once again, the space definitely had an effect on the overall mood of the meet.
            The design lab meetings felt a bit more formal, especially when we had other people around us in the lab. In
            comparison, the exhibition space was closed off and dimly lit, making a relaxing and homely experience, like
            a dinner by candlelight.
        </div>



        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Fellas </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Gabby took advantage of her social media to invite a wider variety of people to different time slots, with
            each meeting having different fellas (and one person who ended up coming twice!) With it being near the end
            of the year, the fellas were tired and didn’t feel like critique, nor did they respond to our messages
            asking if they wanted critique in the days leading up to the talk.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Fellas were completely random, with many not knowing each other and even being completely different majors,
            which was unexpected. The meets with a truly random assortment required me and Gabby to help proctor
            discussion as people would often shy away from conversation. However, once people finished carving and got
            to printing, they would begin to open up and show interest in each other’s work, often getting excited at
            the first print reveal and trading prints with each other.

        <div class="paragraph">
            These talks were led by both me and Gabby with different levels of input, ranging from full input from me to
            being completely hands off. Prior to the first meeting, I had provided a draft copy of my findings to Gabby,
            but for the most part I let her lead how she wanted. My own hosting style relies on my personal energy which
            I think Gabby tried to replicate but wasn’t able to fully get into it. She was still getting into the
            first-time host role as well, adding onto a bit of the awkwardness.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <u><b> Print </b></u>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Due to time constraints, Gabby also ended up using my agendas and invites as templates. From the get go,
            invites were digital since we didn’t have the ability to hand out physical invites before the meets. With
            Gabby as the host, I do think there was a bit of a missed opportunity to take in her own design styles in an
            invite and see how different presentations could affect attendee mood.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            At all Rando Talks, it took a bit but after everyone was settled down and carving, they REALLY went at it.
            Block carving served as a perfect conduit for casual discussion and relaxation across all of my talks as it
            allowed people to zone out and chat. If anything should be taken from what I’ve learned, it’s this. People
            go absolutely BONKERS for printing.

            With that, my Fella Talks had concluded for the semester. I had completed my goals with great success. Print
            as an artifact was made with the invites, agendas, and stamp books. Print as an activity was made through
            our carving and stamping sessions. Most importantly, my excuse to hang out with my friends had paid off. It
            was time to take a long deserved break…

            encourage people to read books, many of them could come off as intimidating or unnecessary to someone
            who just wants to start a small group up. I chose to make my book only 18 pages and write it all in
            “more simple and silly” language, in the spirit of the Fella Talks so that it could serve as an
            introduction to the world of community design.

            Since the semester was nearing a close, I wasn’t able to get much feedback or examples of its use but
            various readers really appreciated the depth I went into the topic while still remaining digestible. It
            is definitely worthwhile to see how this book could be used with the incoming freshman and other
            organizations to see how my research applies to other kinds of communities.

            I had done a lot this year, but there was still much more to learn about community design. What started
            as me being upset with the current state of our program blossomed into a newfound passion in designing
            community interactions and accompanying material for them. There is much to keep improving on, like
            testing more groups of people, different activities, different hosts, etc. - many things that I was
            regrettably unable to take on during this one semester. This is just the beginning of the FELLA TALKS!
