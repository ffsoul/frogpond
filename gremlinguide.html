            Students regularly walk past green areas on their way to class
            without ever thinking about what goes on in those secluded spaces.
            So much can be found in there, from organisms you never would have
            thought would be on campus to the considerable amount of waste left
            behind. To help bring appreciation to the flora and fauna of UT, I
            created a physical interface to help users get into the mindset of a
            dwelling ‚Äúgremlin‚Äù, cast themselves away from society, and go on an

        UT‚Äôs campus offers many locations to slink away and escape, helping
        users disconnect from the professionalism of student life and into a
        world of oddity.

        As a class, we discussed Jenny Odell‚Äôs talk, <a href="https://youtu.be/mNRqswoCVcM">‚ÄúHow to Do Nothing‚Äù </a>, which
        placed an importance on exiting the always working mindset of corporate
        spaces and constant connection, and instead embracing non-intensive
        observation. Nothing meant disconnecting from constant thinking and
        moving into a state of purposeful wandering, often in nature. Moving to
        this state helps us fulfil our human needs of subsistence, leisure, and
        freedom.

      <div class="paragraph">
        To learn more about the environment of UT and the process of purposeful
        wandering, we conducted an ethnographic study through the iNaturalist
        app. We went out using the app to discover plants and animals while
        logging our ethnographic findings.

      <div class="paragraph">
        There was a cycle of aimless wandering to finding plants to
        identification through iNaturalist. The app encouraged exploration
        through the allure of information and accomplishment of a greater
        community goal, but outside factors like weather and traffic would break
        the immersion and pull us away from the activity.

      <div class="paragraph">
        We then moved to studying the physical interface of the Austin Odditrees

        in search for interesting trees.

      />
      <div class="paragraph">
        The guide was intentionally vague on where the trees were, leading to
        moments of confused (but hopeful) wandering. This sparked conversation
        and bonding within our group as we moved towards our goal, getting
        excited as we made it to the crusis point of the tree. Once there, we
        either relished in our victory or were mildly disappointed in what we
        had found. Either way, we contemplated the tree for a while before
        repeating our cycle.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        This guide helped to foster discovery in the seemingly mundane walk that
        we had around Austin. By providing the affordances of a map and hints
        about what we were looking for, we were entranced enough by the prospect
        to make our own fun along the way.

        With the principles of an interface defined, I moved to developing ideas
        for my own interface, eventually settling on getting people to explore
        secluded areas in places they normally pass.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I started working on different ideas for my interface. I was set on
        creating a zine, since I felt that a physical interface would better
        help with the idea of escapism. Dumping my brain out, I generated ideas
        and eventually nailed it down to 4 different concepts.

        Feedback from my peers and professor on concepts 1 and 4 was positive.

        years of punching for concept 4 and thought that concept 1 could work
        well, but recommended me to push my ideas more and challenge myself.
        This led me to pursue the ideas of digging in dirt.

        I took another walk outside to develop my interface, when I stumbled

        disconnected from the outside as I wandered, discovering a wonderland of
        ecology and garbage. There was a sense that I was doing something wrong,
        but in a good way, encouraging me to act mischievously.

        This exploration of the creek was freeing and embodied what I wanted in

        The creek created a sense of smallness which I thought would contribute

        from both themselves and their environment.

        Gremlins are a fictional group of creatures that love exploring hidden

        clean up the trash in the area so that other critters and plants are
        unharmed. However, gremlins are also not that bright and need a guide to
        help them. Thus, they created the Gremlin‚Äôs Guide to UT, informally
        known as the Gremlin Guide.

        Overall, the guide was very positively received. Although the locations
        were hard to find due to the underdeveloped map, the experience itself
        was very enjoyable. The theming helped the users get into the mindset of
        a gremlin, and they wouldn‚Äôt have gone without being prompted by the
        guide. They did request that the experience was even ‚Äúmore gremlin‚Äù

        focused on developing those aspects.

        A second round of feedback from my peers also suggested more interactive
        elements in the zine. The current dirt and creek facts pages felt out of
        place in the guide due to their more educational nature, and also just
        ‚Äúwere not fun.‚Äù The question of what a gremlin was also came up with

        to bring users into our gremlin mindset.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          1. Gremlins enjoy engaging in tomfoolery. Run around and forget about
          being normal. Get weird, get wild, get wacky!
          <br />
          2. Gremlins are mischievous, but not disrespectful. Do not leave a
          mess, damage the den, or harm the critters.
          <br />
          3. Make sure gremlins can enjoy the dens! If you see stuff that could
          hurt the critters, dispose of it properly somewhere else.
          <br />
          4. Greed and pride fuel gremlins. Show off what you found to other
          gremlins by recording it in this book or your phone.
          <br />
          5. Gremlins hide from the world until they have reached the dens.
          One‚Äôs inner gremlin often awakens in secluded areas.
          <br />
          6. Gremlins do enjoy gathering in small packs though. Gather your
          friends to form your own gremlin party.

        Optional: While on your adventure, jump around while hunched over with
        your arms out like a velociraptor. If with others, try speaking with
        crude language in squeaky voices.

        With this manifesto developed, I started work on the next version. I
        removed the fact sections as they were too "big brain" for a gremlin to
        note down, replacing them interactive discovery charts for users to draw
        in what they found. I also left an open ended page to record any
        miscellaneous information.

      <div class="paragraph">
        I decided to limit this prototype to two areas so I could better tune
        the experience. With a better drawn map, I included markers, hints, and
        rough drawings of the locations to guide users to the dens, making sure
        not to handhold them with too much information. This side also has note
        taking areas and featured finds to promote investigation.

        With the guide now finished, I moved to producing physical copies for
        testing.

        Letting others use the guide, I test to see if it fosters curiosity and

        Once again, feedback was highly positive. Users ‚Äúreally enjoyed being a
        gremlin‚Äù and had a very fun time walking around and exploring. One
        tester noted that ‚ÄúIt felt a bit strange at first and I did feel like a
        bit of a weirdo going places where people don't normally go, but I
        enjoyed how you framed that experience as intentionally uncomfortable.‚Äù

        The new discovery charts were also very much welcome, with users putting
        them to good use.

        There were fair critiques of the guide though. The map was cumbersome to
        use, and users were left slightly confused at the locations of the dens
        due to the non-descript drawings. Users also wished the activity was a
        bit more guided, specifically wanting more special finds to reward
        choosing a location.

        Overall, this project has ignited my interest in physical interfaces and
        interactions with ecology.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        With this project concluded, I can say that I am satisfied with the
        experience I was able to bring to others.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Future developments for this project:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        - More Locations - Having 4 locations on a guide feels like it hits a
        sweet spot of having not to many choices to overwhelm someone, but still
        offering different options so that users don‚Äôt have to return to the
        same location over and over.
        <br />
        - Better Descriptions - I would like to write more about the locations
        to help guide users, but I would also want to make sure they stay simple
        enough for a gremlin to easily understand them.
        <br />
        - Other Venues? - I would like to explore other locations from around
        campus, to other areas in Austin, to even creating a general field guide
        that could apply anywhere.
        <br />
        - Immersion - I think using different paper, printing with a risograph,
        etc. can help improve the experience of holding a guide made by
        gremlins.
